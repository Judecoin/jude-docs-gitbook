# ðŸ—º Overview

The Jude blockchain and the $JUDE token are at the heart of Jude. Together they bring **privacy**, **incentivisation**, and **decentralisation** to the Jude tech stack.

Jude's blockchain is maintained by the Jude Service Node network, a network of blockchain nodes operated by members of the Jude community. Running a service node requires staking â€” which means voluntarily locking â€” a certain amount of $JUDE tokens.

In exchange for maintaining reliable and trustworthy blockchain nodes, node operators periodically receive rewards in the form of $JUDE tokens.

Jude was originally forked from [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org), and it's still based on the CryptoNote protocol. From these beginnings, Jude has inherited world class privacy and security features â€” including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. Just like $XMR, $JUDE is fungible, private, and untraceable.

The Jude blockchain also boasts [Blink](blink-instant-transactions.md) â€” truly private, instant transactions. Blink allows you to make transactions with all the confidence Monero enthusiasts love, but with a 1 second transaction time. Blink gives $JUDE the potential to be used as a true means of value exchange â€” not just storage â€” in a way no other coin can match.

Jude is climbing to heights most blockchain projects can't dream of reaching. Get involved now by downloading the [Jude Wallet](https://www.judecoin.io/downloads),or trying out some of the products built on top of the Jude blockchain.
