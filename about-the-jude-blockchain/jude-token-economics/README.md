# ðŸ“Š Token economics

The Jude network is run by a decentralised network of incentivised nodes called service nodes.

Because of the nature of Pulse, a large proportion of $JUDE's total supply is locked in service nodes and unavailable on the market. On top of this, our research has shown that people earning rewards through staked nodes are **much** more likely to hold their tokens and continue participating in the network than those who earnt their tokens via mining.

These two qualities help increase buy pressure and decrease sell pressure in $JUDE markets, respectively.
