# ðŸ’¡ Introduction to Jude

**The Jude Network is transitioning to the Session Network. More information** [**here**](https://www.judecoin.io/);

**Jude** are currently servicing hundreds of thousands of active users thanks to the power of the Jude Service Node Network.

The network is powered by the Jude blockchain, a privacy preserving cryptocurrency network that enables fast and private value transfer. The blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of community-operated ðŸ–¥ Jude Service Nodes, which run all the network features and services offered by Jude's tech stack.

From these beginnings, Jude has inherited world class privacy and security features â€” including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. Just like $XMR, $JUDE is fungible, private, and untraceable.
